QUICOOK is an augmented reality device for cooking. It allows to prepare a recipe
by following the projected instructions on the worktop. The steps are juxtaposed
to the user's gestures in real time, indicating how to proceed, and thus teaching
by practicing. Preparing the recipe can be made by several persons at the same
time. The device will distinguish the progression of each one. The "social sharing"
is double : beyond the regular sharing videos, pictures, recipes via social media,
Quicook allows to collaborate in order to prepare the recipe in the same place.
It is especially adapted for workshops or cooking lessons in group.

A camera and a video projector are fixed over the worktop. The human-machine
interaction is made with the visual sensors fixed on the worktop and the cooking
utensils.
The camera follows each sensor and the video projector displays the good informations,
text, videos, following each step of the recipe. The user can then follow
the indications and improve their skill by imitation.
